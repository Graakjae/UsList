# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

## Troubleshooting

### Warnings

**Media Library Warning**: When using Expo Go, you may see a warning about media library permissions. This is expected behavior in Expo Go. To test full media library functionality (like saving QR codes to gallery), you need to create a development build:

```bash
npx expo install expo-dev-client
eas build --profile development --platform ios
eas build --profile development --platform android
```

**Layout Warning**: The warning about "Layout children must be of type Screen" is typically a false positive in development and doesn't affect functionality.
